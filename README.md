This respository contains a set of sensors, the data collectors for [FluxMon](https://fluxmon.de).

### What's in it for me? ###

Unfortunately, not much yet.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* If you'd like to get in touch, send me an [email](mailto:i.am@svedr.in) or talk to me (Svedrin) on the Freenode IRC network.
* I also regularly hang out at the Linux User Group or the [mag.lab](http://mag.lab.sh) in Fulda.
