    # Sadly, this code cannot cope with situations in which the lockfile exists, but there
    # is no process using it. This situation arises when the owner process does not get around
    # to actually unlink()ing the lockfile, e.g. due to a crash, the node being STONITHED,
    # malicious sysadmins testing their cluster or other dubious reasons that I can't think of
    # right now.
    # For this, we require locks that are bound to file descriptors, so they disappear together
    # with the process owning the locks.
    #
    # This mechanism works in two stages:
    # 1. Get a file descriptor on the lockfile, making sure we don't accidentally replace the
    #    file in the process or we couldn't be sure that flock() uses the very same file that
    #    other processes use for locking.
    # 2. flock() the file to tell other processes that there is someone alive using the file.
